# ec2-to-ssh

This is the EC2-to-SSH tool.

## Motivation

EC2 instances, EC2 instances, EC2 instances! So many instances!

In case you are one of those lucky guys who needs to connect to EC2 instances every now and then you
most likely understand the pain of managing your SSH configuration in order to keep up with all the information
of old hosts (that don't even exist, anymore) and new ones you don't have in your configuration file.

No more! Just use this tool!
